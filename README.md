You've stumbled upon the source code for the Android and Glass development tutorials from [Obsessive Compulsive Developers](http://www.ocddevelopers.com/).

If the project you are running uses Google Play Services, you will have to import the library project from the sdk/extras directory. 

Happy coding!
